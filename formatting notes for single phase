so these notes map the column values we get from the .DAT single phase version.

a typical row of data is like so:

Data:
14967,12000,12,00,00,2335,00,00,07,500,00,00,00000000,00,00
this data came from a file E8046ITV.DAT

there are no column headings in the raw file but there are more columns than is required for a single phase deltrax
Excel report output and less than is required for a deltrax 3 phase report. So, its likely the basic raw file with 15 columns
is used for both the single phase report and the three phase report and the Deltrax software  makes some extra
calculations and adds them into the three phase report export as extra columns.

The Energy tracker display shows it can display Volts (123), Amps (123), Kw,PF,Kva,Kvar,Time,date and pulse
That is 13 so obviously some values in Excel report are derived by the software calculation.

original raw export .DAT column headings for the single phase Excel report come out as follows in the excel report export:
Date	Time	I1	KW	KVA	KVAR	PF	In	V1	Hz	Pulse
so the final excel report for single phase ignores some of the column values that  are not needed (eg V2, V3 etc)
Below I show a full fifteen column row content under the headings that  would apply if it were a three phase
Data:
date  time  I1 I2 I3  V1   V2    V3     KW    Hz   Kva    Kvar    col12         PF  pulse
14967,12000,12,00,00,2335, 00,   00,    07,  500,   00,    00,   00000000,      00,   00

However, I need some reliable actual three phase .DAT files to finalise what some of the last headings should be
so now I have uploaded a three phase EAAP6ATV .dat file for kennedy college new ross that  I can use to see how deltrax uses the data to produce a report.
I have also  added a second three phase data file from colaiste an Atha for comparison.
