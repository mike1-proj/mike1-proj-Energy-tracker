so these notes map the column values we get from the .DAT single phase version.

a typical row of data is like so:

Data:
14967,12000,12,00,00,2335,00,00,07,500,00,00,00000000,00,00

there are no column headings in the raw file but there are more columns than is required for a single phase deltrax
report output and less than is required for a deltrax 3 phase report. So, its likely the basic raw file with 15 columns
is used for both the single phase report and the three phase report and the Deltrax software  made some extra
calculations and added them into the three phase report as extra columns.
The Energy tracker display shows it can display Volts (123), Amps (123), Kw,PF,Kva,Kvar, col12(TBD),Time,date and pulse
That is 15

original raw export .DAT column headings should probably be as follows:

Data:
date  time  I1 I2 I3  V1   V2    V3     KW    Hz   Kva    Kvar    col12         PF  pulse
14967,12000,12,00,00,2335, 00,   00,    07,  500,   00,    00,   00000000,      00,   00

However, I need some reliable actual three phase .DAT files to finalise what some of the last headings should be
so now I have uploaded a three phase EAAP6ATV .dat file for kennedy college new ross that  I can use to see how deltrax uses the data to produce a report.
I have also  added a second three phase data file from colaiste an Atha for comparison.
